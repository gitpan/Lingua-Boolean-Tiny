NAME
    Lingua::Boolean::Tiny - a smaller Lingua::Boolean, with support for more
    languages

SYNOPSIS
       use 5.010;
       use Lingua::Boolean::Tiny qw( boolean );
   
       my $response = "ja";  # German for "yes"
   
       if (boolean $response) {
          say "Yes!";
       }
       else {
          say "No!";
       }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an API roughly compatible with Lingua::Boolean but
    has no non-core dependencies, and supports Perl 5.6.2+ (though Perl
    versions earlier than 5.8 have pretty crummy Unicode support).

    Lingua::Boolean::Tiny includes hand-written support for the world's
    twelve most commonly spoken languages (Standard Chinese, English,
    Castillian Spanish, Hindi, Russian, Arabic, Portuguese, Bengali, French,
    Malay, German and Japanese). Lingua::Boolean::Tiny::More (which is auto
    loaded on demand) provides support for almost any other language you can
    think of, but it may not be to the same standard.

    The string "1" is always true, and "0" is always false.

  Object-Oriented Interface
   Constructor
    "Lingua::Boolean::Tiny->new($lang)"
        Construct a new object supporting the given language. $lang should
        be an ISO language code (e.g. "en" for English or "zh" for Chinese).

        If the language is not recognised, a warning is issued and an object
        with support for just English is returned.

    "Lingua::Boolean::Tiny->new(\@lang)"
        Construct a new object supporting the union of multiple languages.

        Unrecognised languages are simply ignored.

        Because a string could be interpreted differently in different
        languages (e.g. "no" is a negative answer in English, but
        affirmative in Polish), the order is significant - in case of
        ambiguities, the earlier language wins.

    "Lingua::Boolean::Tiny->new()"
        Construct a new object supporting the union of the twelve main
        supported languages.

    "Lingua::Boolean::Tiny->new_strict($lang)"
        Like "new", but rather than defaulting to English, returns undef.

    You can alternatively construct objects using class names based on the
    language name:

       my $indonesian = Lingua::Boolean::Tiny::Malay->new();

   Methods
    "boolean($text)"
        Returns true if the text seems to indicate an affirmative answer
        (e.g. "yes"); returns false if the text seems to indicate an
        negitive answer (e.g. "no"); returns undef if the meaning of the
        text could not be established.

    "languages"
        Returns the name of the languages supported by this object.

    "langs"
        Returns the ISO codes of the languages supported by this object.

    "yes"
        Returns a canonical "yes" string for the language. This method only
        exists in objects which support a single language, not a union.

    "no"
        Returns a canonical "no" string for the language. This method only
        exists in objects which support a single language, not a union.

    "yesno($boolean)"
        Returns a canonical "yes" or "no" string for the language, depending
        upon whether $boolean is true or false. This method only exists in
        objects which support a single language, not a union.

  Functional Interface
    This module provides several functions:

    "boolean $text, $lang"
        Shortcut for:

           Lingua::Boolean::Tiny->new($lang)->boolean($text)

        $lang is optional, but may be an ISO language code or a union
        thereof.

        This function is exported by default.

    "Lingua::Boolean::Tiny::languages()"
        Returns the full names of all supported languages.

        This function is not exported.

    "Lingua::Boolean::Tiny::langs()"
        Returns the ISO codes of all supported languages.

        This function is not exported.
